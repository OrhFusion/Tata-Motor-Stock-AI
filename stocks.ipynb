Leveraging historical stock data and utilizing a **Decision Tree Regressor**, this model aims to provide accurate, data-driven forecasts, supporting investors with short-term stock price predictions.\n\n\n\n## 🔍 Project Description\n\nUsing historical stock data from **Yahoo Finance**, this model analyzes key stock market indicators, including:\n\n- **Open Price**: The opening price of the stock\n\n- **Low Price**: The lowest price of the stock for the day\n\n- **High Price**: The highest price of the stock for the day\n\n- **Volume**: The trading volume of the stock\n\n\n\nThese features are used to train a **Decision Tree Regressor** model, which then predicts the closing price, offering insights into potential price movements and aiding decision-making for traders and investors.\n\n\n\n## 📊 Data Collection\n\nThe dataset used for this project is sourced from **Yahoo Finance** via the `yfinance` library. Here’s a sample code snippet used to download the data:\n\n\n\n```python\n\nimport yfinance as yf\n\n\n\n# Download Tata Motors stock data\n\ndata = yf.download('TATAMOTORS.NS', start='YYYY-MM-DD',
